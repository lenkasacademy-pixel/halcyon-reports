# Halcyon Pain Management — Meta Ads calls report

Client-facing report for **Halcyon Pain Management**, covering **both** ad accounts:

| Account | ID | What it runs |
|---|---|---|
| Pallavi Halcyon | `1999324147481098` | Call ads + website-lead campaigns |
| Pallavi Kiran | `694358492762548` | Call ads only |

Live: https://lenkasacademy-pixel.github.io/halcyon-reports/

A single self-contained `index.html` with a **month tab bar** (August /
September). Figures are baked into the `DAILY_AUG` / `DAILY_SEP` arrays and the
`MONTHS` object near the bottom of the file — nothing calls the network.

**Scope: two tabs.** August 2026 (1–31, complete) and September 2026 (1–13).
September deliberately stops at the 11th — Meta keeps revising the most recent
~48h, and the live part-day moves between calls minutes apart. Showing it would
read as a collapse in spend that is not real.

## What it shows

- Amount spent, phone calls placed, blended cost per call, reach.
- A three-panel day-wise chart on one shared calendar: daily spend stacked by
  account (with the website-lead spend split out), calls placed stacked by
  account, and cost per call against that period's average. One hover reads all three.
- A two-up comparison card carrying each tab's headline finding (August's
  1–9 vs 10–31 split; September against the August average).
- A **call-quality funnel**: placed → 20s+ → 60s+, with each step's share of
  placed calls and its true cost.
- Per-campaign totals for the call campaigns and, separately, the website-lead
  campaigns.
- Calls and cost per call by age band, both accounts combined.
- The full day-by-day table for the selected month.

## Snapshot

Frozen **12 Sep 2026**.

| | August (1–31) | September (1–13) |
|---|---|---|
| Spent | ₹3,62,046.60 | ₹1,38,121.90 |
| Calls placed | 5,144 | 1,912 |
| Cost per call | **₹59.99** | **₹70.08** |
| Lasted 20s+ | 1,448 (28.1%) · ₹213.12 | 580 (30.3%) · ₹231.03 |
| Lasted 60s+ | 608 (11.8%) · ₹507.57 | 271 (14.2%) · **₹494.46** |
| Pallavi Halcyon | ₹2,18,901.90 / 3,063 / ₹54.02 | ₹48,144.67 / 797 / ₹60.41 |
| Pallavi Kiran | ₹1,43,144.70 / 2,081 / ₹68.79 | ₹85,853.88 / 1,115 / ₹77.00 |

September is tracking August's *second half* (₹72.36), not its first nine days
(₹44.82) — **but** a higher share of September's calls connect, so a 60-second
call is actually *cheaper* than in August despite each tap costing 18% more.
That is the one metric on which September is ahead.

All figures are **ex-GST** (Meta bills 18% GST on top in India). Unlike
`o2-reports`, this page does not show a GST-inclusive billed total — if the
client asks for one, add it, don't silently change the per-call numbers.

## The findings

Cost per call rose **61%** on 10 August: ₹44.82 (2,310 calls on ₹1,03,528) for
1–9 Aug, ₹72.36 (2,834 calls on ₹2,05,075) for 10–31 Aug. Two causes, both real:

1. ₹53,444 — 34% of the Pallavi Halcyon budget from the 10th — moved to
   website-lead campaigns, which do not produce calls.
2. `Halcyon | Calls — Age 35+ | FB only | CBO` (`120254451805720348`) stopped
   after 8 Aug. It returned **410 calls at ₹19.60**, the month's best by a wide
   margin, on ~₹1,000/day. Worth restarting — still off as of 13 Sep.

**September (1–13).** ₹70.08 a call, 17% above the August average — the gap
widened again after four days of narrowing. Website-lead spend has almost stopped
(₹4,123 in the first three days, nothing since), so the budget is back on the
phone. `ad set level 3 camp` is the standout at **₹44.88** across 561 calls on
only ~₹1,937/day — the one line beating August's average.
The drag is the Pallavi Kiran account: 78% more spend than Pallavi Halcyon at
₹76.90 vs ₹60.84 a call, with `New Leads Campaign` weakest at ₹92.90.

## 20s and 60s calls are derived, not reported

There is **no count field** for call duration. Meta returns only an average cost
per connect, so each figure is:

    calls20s = spend / cost_per_action_type:click_to_call_native_20s_call_connect
    calls60s = spend / cost_per_action_type:click_to_call_native_60s_call_connect

**Every division must land on a whole number** — that is the check that the
derivation is sound. Assert it; if one does not, something is wrong. (Confirmed
for all 13 campaign-periods in the current data.) Same method as `o2-reports`.

A day with spend but no `click_to_call_native_60s_*` key genuinely had zero
60-second calls — record 0, do not treat the missing key as an error.

These are derived **per campaign per period**, which is why they appear in the
funnel and the campaign table but not in the day table. Daily duration figures
are possible but need one `cost_per_action_type` pull per account per month with
`time_increment` — large responses, so expect them to spill to a file.

Watch the quality/price trade: `Halcyon | Calls — Age 35+ | FB only | CBO` has
by far the cheapest placed calls (₹19.60) **and** the cheapest 20s calls
(₹91.32), but the worst 60s rate of any campaign (3.4%) — its calls skew short,
so the headline number flatters it. In September, `7788- call ads-new` is the
one to watch: 76 calls, only 4 past 60 seconds, at ₹2,168 each.

## Two result types — do not merge them

**Call campaigns** report `results` with indicator
`actions:click_to_call_native_call_placed` ("Phone calls placed"). There is no
queryable `calls` field — `ads_get_field_context` returns `calls`,
`call_confirm` and `click_to_call_*` as unknown. Same trap as `o2-reports`.

**Website-lead campaigns** (Pallavi Halcyon only, from 10 Aug) each optimise for
a *different* pixel event, so their counts are **not one comparable number**:

| Campaign | Event |
|---|---|
| `Halcyon \| LP 8585 \| Website Leads` | `HContacted` |
| `Halcyon \| LP 7788 \| Website Leads` | `HContacted` |
| `Halcyon \| LP 8585 \| Website Leads \| 7788` | `HEnquiry` |
| `Halcyon \| LP 8585 \| Website Leads \| TEST - Copy` | `offsite_conversion.fb_pixel_lead` |

The page names the event on every row and keeps this spend **out of cost per
call**. Blending it in reads ₹70.38 and overstates what a call costs — don't.

## Refreshing

`DAILY_AUG` / `DAILY_SEP` rows are
`[day, a1CallSpend, a1Calls, a1WebSpend, a1WebLeads, a2CallSpend, a2Calls, impressions, reachSum, linkClicks]`
where `a1` = Pallavi Halcyon, `a2` = Pallavi Kiran. `day` is the day of month.

Everything else a tab shows — headline totals, narrative copy, campaign tables,
age rows — lives in the `MONTHS` object keyed `aug` / `sep`. **To add a month,
add a `DAILY_*` array and a `MONTHS` entry, then add one `<button class="tab">`
with a matching `data-month`.** Nothing else is month-specific.

Pull with Meta MCP `ads_get_ad_entities`, `level: "campaign"`,
`time_increment: "1"`, one call per account.

- **Fetch by `object_ids`, not by listing all campaigns.** Pallavi Halcyon has
  ~30 campaigns and Pallavi Kiran ~80; Meta returns a row for every campaign ×
  every day, almost all empty, which blows past the row cap and silently drops
  campaigns. Query the month at campaign level first to find which campaigns
  actually spent, then re-fetch only those ids with `time_increment`.
- The daily response for 5 campaigns × 31 days already exceeds the tool's output
  limit and gets spilled to a file — parse it with `jq`/python, don't try to read
  it inline.
- **Always reconcile.** Pull `level: "ad_account"` with `time_increment: "1"` for
  the same range and assert the campaign sums equal the account's own daily spend
  *and* impressions for every day. On the August pull both accounts matched to
  the rupee on all 31 days — that check is what proves no campaign was missed. It
  also earns its keep: on the September pull it flagged a ₹28.35 gap on the part-day
  that turned out to be Meta still settling, not a dropped campaign.
- Age figures come from a separate call with `breakdowns: ["age"]` (no
  `time_increment`). Assert each campaign's age rows sum to its month total.
  ₹1.93 and 1 call land in an `Unknown` band and are omitted from the age table.
- `reachSum` is the sum of each day's reach and double-counts people across days.
  Meta's de-duplicated August reach was 11,39,310 (Pallavi Halcyon, frequency
  2.68) and 6,12,279 (Pallavi Kiran, frequency 3.25); September 1-11 is 2,88,579
  (2.13) and 3,82,632 (2.61) — those come from a call *without* `time_increment`
  and are quoted in the footer only.
- Recent days keep settling for ~48h; re-pull the whole month rather than
  appending.
- `campCalls` rows are
  `[name, account(1|2), daysLive, spend, callsPlaced, calls20s, calls60s]`. The
  account flag drives the colour dot — keep it correct when adding rows, and keep
  each month's `calls20` / `calls60` totals equal to the sum of its rows.
## Mobile

The page is built to work at 320–430px, and there are a few rules to keep:

- **Tables pin their first column.** Under 760px the campaign/day name is
  `position: sticky; left: 0` inside the `.t-scroll` container, so it stays put
  while the numbers swipe under it. A `.swipe` hint sits above each table.
- **Inline percentages hide under 760px** (`.pct`). Without that, a numeric
  column ends up permanently parked under the pinned name column and its leading
  digits get cut — it reads like a data bug.
- **Charts narrow their own gutter.** `PAD_L` drops 54 → 38 and spend ticks
  switch to `₹20k` form when the plot is under 520px, or the y-axis labels eat
  the plot.
- **Day labels step from day 1** (`(day-1) % every === 0`), never "first + last +
  every Nth" — that older rule printed 30 and 31 on top of each other.
- The cost-per-call average moves from a label over the line into the panel
  title (`#cpc-unit`) when narrow.
- KPI tiles are 2-up down to 360px, 1-up below.

- **`<meta name="viewport">` must stay on line 1.** Without it mobile Safari
  renders at a 980px virtual viewport and scales the whole page down, so every
  media query above is dead and the page looks like the desktop layout shrunk.
  The Artifact wrapper injects its own viewport tag, so the artifact copy hides
  this bug — only the GitHub Pages copy shows it. A duplicate tag in the artifact
  is harmless; both carry the same directive.

Verify changes at phone width by loading the page in a 390px-wide `<iframe>` —
resizing the browser window does not reliably change the viewport. **Note the
iframe does not reproduce the mobile virtual viewport**, so it cannot catch a
missing viewport meta; check that tag separately, or open the real URL on a
phone.

- The file is deliberately **pure ASCII**: the rupee sign is `&#8377;` in markup
  and `\u20B9` in script (via the `RS` constant), dashes are entities/escapes. It
  renders correctly even when served without a charset header. Keep it that way.
- Update the snapshot date in the masthead and in this README.
