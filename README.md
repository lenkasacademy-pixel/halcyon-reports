# Halcyon Pain Management — Meta Ads calls report

Client-facing report for **Halcyon Pain Management**, covering **both** ad accounts:

| Account | ID | What it runs |
|---|---|---|
| Pallavi Halcyon | `1999324147481098` | Call ads + website-lead campaigns |
| Pallavi Kiran | `694358492762548` | Call ads only |

A single self-contained `index.html` with a **month tab bar** (August /
September). Figures are baked into the `DAILY_AUG` / `DAILY_SEP` arrays and the
`MONTHS` object near the bottom of the file — nothing calls the network.

**Scope: two tabs.** August 2026 (1–31, complete) and September 2026 (1–10).
September deliberately stops at the 10th — Meta keeps revising the most recent
~48h, and on the 11 Sep pull the part-day was still moving between calls
(account 2 drifted ₹28.35 in minutes). Showing it would read as a collapse in
spend that is not real.

## What it shows

- Amount spent, phone calls placed, blended cost per call, reach.
- A three-panel day-wise chart on one shared calendar: daily spend stacked by
  account (with the website-lead spend split out), calls placed stacked by
  account, and cost per call against that period's average. One hover reads all three.
- A two-up comparison card carrying each tab's headline finding (August's
  1–9 vs 10–31 split; September against the August average).
- Per-campaign totals for the call campaigns and, separately, the website-lead
  campaigns.
- Calls and cost per call by age band, both accounts combined.
- The full day-by-day table for the selected month.

## Snapshot

Frozen **11 Sep 2026**.

| | August (1–31) | September (1–10) |
|---|---|---|
| Spent | ₹3,62,046.60 | ₹1,06,504.23 |
| Calls placed | 5,144 | 1,450 |
| Cost per call | **₹59.99** | **₹70.61** |
| Pallavi Halcyon | ₹2,18,901.90 / 3,063 / ₹54.02 | ₹41,188.49 / 604 / ₹61.37 |
| Pallavi Kiran | ₹1,43,144.70 / 2,081 / ₹68.79 | ₹65,315.74 / 846 / ₹77.21 |

September is tracking August's *second half* (₹72.36), not its first nine days
(₹44.82).

All figures are **ex-GST** (Meta bills 18% GST on top in India). Unlike
`o2-reports`, this page does not show a GST-inclusive billed total — if the
client asks for one, add it, don't silently change the per-call numbers.

## The findings

Cost per call rose **61%** on 10 August: ₹44.82 (2,310 calls on ₹1,03,528) for
1–9 Aug, ₹72.36 (2,834 calls on ₹2,05,075) for 10–31 Aug. Two causes, both real:

1. ₹53,444 — 34% of the Pallavi Halcyon budget from the 10th — moved to
   website-lead campaigns, which do not produce calls.
2. `Halcyon | Calls — Age 35+ | FB only | CBO` (`120254451805720348`) stopped
   after 8 Aug. It returned **410 calls at ₹19.60**, the month's best by a wide
   margin, on ~₹1,000/day. Worth restarting — still off as of 10 Sep.

**September (1–10).** ₹70.61 a call, 18% above the August average. Website-lead
spend has almost stopped (₹4,123 in the first three days, nothing since), so the
budget is back on the phone. `ad set level 3 camp` is the standout at **₹46.49**
across 413 calls on only ~₹1,920/day — the one line beating August's average.
The drag is the Pallavi Kiran account: 61% more spend than Pallavi Halcyon at
₹77.21 vs ₹61.37 a call, with `New Leads Campaign` weakest at ₹89.65.

## Two result types — do not merge them

**Call campaigns** report `results` with indicator
`actions:click_to_call_native_call_placed` ("Phone calls placed"). There is no
queryable `calls` field — `ads_get_field_context` returns `calls`,
`call_confirm` and `click_to_call_*` as unknown. Same trap as `o2-reports`.

**Website-lead campaigns** (Pallavi Halcyon only, from 10 Aug) each optimise for
a *different* pixel event, so their counts are **not one comparable number**:

| Campaign | Event |
|---|---|
| `Halcyon \| LP 8585 \| Website Leads` | `HContacted` |
| `Halcyon \| LP 7788 \| Website Leads` | `HContacted` |
| `Halcyon \| LP 8585 \| Website Leads \| 7788` | `HEnquiry` |
| `Halcyon \| LP 8585 \| Website Leads \| TEST - Copy` | `offsite_conversion.fb_pixel_lead` |

The page names the event on every row and keeps this spend **out of cost per
call**. Blending it in reads ₹70.38 and overstates what a call costs — don't.

## Refreshing

`DAILY_AUG` / `DAILY_SEP` rows are
`[day, a1CallSpend, a1Calls, a1WebSpend, a1WebLeads, a2CallSpend, a2Calls, impressions, reachSum, linkClicks]`
where `a1` = Pallavi Halcyon, `a2` = Pallavi Kiran. `day` is the day of month.

Everything else a tab shows — headline totals, narrative copy, campaign tables,
age rows — lives in the `MONTHS` object keyed `aug` / `sep`. **To add a month,
add a `DAILY_*` array and a `MONTHS` entry, then add one `<button class="tab">`
with a matching `data-month`.** Nothing else is month-specific.

Pull with Meta MCP `ads_get_ad_entities`, `level: "campaign"`,
`time_increment: "1"`, one call per account.

- **Fetch by `object_ids`, not by listing all campaigns.** Pallavi Halcyon has
  ~30 campaigns and Pallavi Kiran ~80; Meta returns a row for every campaign ×
  every day, almost all empty, which blows past the row cap and silently drops
  campaigns. Query the month at campaign level first to find which campaigns
  actually spent, then re-fetch only those ids with `time_increment`.
- The daily response for 5 campaigns × 31 days already exceeds the tool's output
  limit and gets spilled to a file — parse it with `jq`/python, don't try to read
  it inline.
- **Always reconcile.** Pull `level: "ad_account"` with `time_increment: "1"` for
  the same range and assert the campaign sums equal the account's own daily spend
  *and* impressions for every day. On the August pull both accounts matched to
  the rupee on all 31 days — that check is what proves no campaign was missed. It
  also earns its keep: on the September pull it flagged a ₹28.35 gap on the part-day
  that turned out to be Meta still settling, not a dropped campaign.
- Age figures come from a separate call with `breakdowns: ["age"]` (no
  `time_increment`). Assert each campaign's age rows sum to its month total.
  ₹1.93 and 1 call land in an `Unknown` band and are omitted from the age table.
- `reachSum` is the sum of each day's reach and double-counts people across days.
  Meta's de-duplicated August reach was 11,39,310 (Pallavi Halcyon, frequency
  2.68) and 6,12,279 (Pallavi Kiran, frequency 3.25) — those come from a call
  *without* `time_increment` and are quoted in the footer only.
- Recent days keep settling for ~48h; re-pull the whole month rather than
  appending.
- `CAMP_CALLS` carries an account flag (`1` or `2`) that drives the colour dot —
  keep it correct when adding rows.
- The file is deliberately **pure ASCII**: the rupee sign is `&#8377;` in markup
  and `\u20B9` in script (via the `RS` constant), dashes are entities/escapes. It
  renders correctly even when served without a charset header. Keep it that way.
- Update the snapshot date in the masthead and in this README.
